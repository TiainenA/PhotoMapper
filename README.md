# PhotoMapper
Takes a folder of photos and places on a map and makes a html of it


Current 2022-12-31 state:

Set pictures with location data in a folder and run pm_maps.py where you define this folder.
If nothing goes wrong the script will first load the pictures in the photoFolder-class and then feed that to the map.
Then index.html (or what ever you choose) will pop out

Note: the error handling is quite horrible, but will improve overtime
